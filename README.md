# Fantastic Trivia App

## Project Description

The Fantastic Trivia Game (TFTG) is a trivia game application that will allow players to answer a set of 
questions from selected categories and post their score to a leaderboard for other players to see. 
Players can create an account, login with created credentials, and then select a category to answer a question set of that category. 
Players can also view and edit their profile information. Administrators can login, and create question sets by category and difficulty, 
with questions pulled from a trivia API. Administrators can also view leaderboards, and remove players from leaderboards or ban/suspend users for suspicious activity.
